    Behavior Trees are structures commonly used in robotics breaking down complicated tasks into subtasks and organizing them into easily readable and programable structures. Unfortunately, it is difficult to perform a formal safety analysis on Behavior Trees, especially when having multiple robots performing different tasks in parallel. In this paper, we algorithmically convert Behavior Trees to basic State Machines, and proceed to combine two different constructed State Machines by taking the product space. This process allows for a simple safety check using reachability of the system to unsafe states. We apply this technique to a complicated Electric Vehicle battery dissasembly task, where a humanoid robot and 6DOF robotic arm are required to operate collaboratively. This demonstrates a specific application for this generalizable method.
